## Summary
In this challenge, you will dive in to SQL - Structured Query Language for databases.  If you are new to SQL and databases, make sure to watch some of the videos listed on the [Week 7 Readme](../readme.md)

## Release 0: Go to [SQLzoo](http://sqlzoo.net/wiki/Main_Page)
Start the first set of exercises "SELECT basics".  Complete this set and complete the quiz that is linked to at the bottom. ** DO NOT CREATE AN ACCOUNT FIRST - There is an annoying bug in SQLZoo.**


## Release 1: [Create an account](http://sqlzoo.net/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Main+Page&type=signup)
Now you are able to create an account so you can save your quiz results and return to SQLzoo whenever you want.  Choose "local" as your domain.  (NOTE: you need to complete some SQL questions before you can create an account.  

## Release 2: Complete the following sections along with their quizzes:  
You may (will probably) want to do some research as you go. [w3schools.com](http://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp) is a pretty good reference.
 
* 1 SELECT basics
* 2 SELECT from World
* 3 SELECT from Nobel (the quiz for this section is not mandatory)
* 5 SUM and COUNT
* 6 JOIN (#8-13 of the tutorial is **BONUS**!)

You will need to do some research!  Choose your search terminology well.  Honing your research skills are a big part of the challenge.  Are you staying focused in your research?  Are you surveying multiple links instead of choosing just the first one?  Are you saving interesting background info for later reading?  Be conscious of a research methodology that works for you.

## Release 0: BONUS:  Dive into the other sections!  Follow the tutorials and take the quizzes to deepen your SQL skills.

## Release 0: When you are finished, access your quiz results by going to your profile page (link is in the upper right corner), taking a screenshot of the scores and results, uploading the screenshot to imgur.com, and saving the URL to the challenge gist.   *(This is part of the challenge!  How do you create a link in markdown?  How do you take a screenshot of a partial screen? How do you use an image hosting website?)*

## Release 0: Reflect.  Take a moment to choose a concept in SQL that was very confusing at first, but with some practice (and maybe some research) you figured it out.  With your audience as your fellow students, explain this concept.  What made you confused initially?  What clarified the concept?  Is there a technique that you can use in the future when confused?

## Release 0: Review.  Look at other solution gists and look at your fellow student's reflections.  Are there any great learning techniques shared?  Any concepts clarified?  Take a moment to comment on other student's insights and thank them for taking the time to share.

## Release 0: Redo your weakest section.  Take 10 minutes to redo the section that was hardest for you.  What can you learn from it being "hard"?


#### Troubleshooting Profile Creation
If you're getting error messages trying to create a profile and you're not sure why, try this:
1. Do a lesson and complete the quiz
2. Submit the quiz
3. Now create a new account. For "Your Domain" select "local"ï»¿
